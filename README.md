Examples and exercises with Lisp and an application to AI.

## Introduction

The repository its subdivided into two parts, the first part its an introduction to Lisp here you can find a bunch of exercises to understand the sintaxis of Common Lisp. (There have been many versions of Lisp, I used Common Lisp which is the most widely accepted standard). 

The second part is a list of IA exercises clearly documented; contains a short description of the problem ,the algorithm to solve it, input and output of each function. 

For the project I worked with SBCL compiler, SLIME to run and compile easily the code and Spacemacs as my editor.

FInally, [here is](http://norvig.com/paip-preface.html#whylisp) an explanation why IÂ´d used Lisp for AI.


## Prerequisities

* Install ["SBCL"](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html) <br />
* Install ["SLIME"](https://github.com/slime/slime) <br />
* Install ["Spacemacs"](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)

## Usage for Lisp Examples
1. Open your Spacemacs. <br>
2. Press ```ctrl x ``` and type ```slime```.  <br>
3. Open a lisp file.  <br>
4. Press  ```ctrl-c-p``` after function to compile it: ```(defun Hello() (list 'Hellow_World))```.
5. Press again ```ctrl-c-p``` after the usage of function: ```(Hello)```.
6. See the result. ```(HELLOW_WORLD)```.

## Usage for Artificial Intelligence & Theoretical Computer
1. Open your Spacemacs. <br>
2. Press ```ctrl x ``` and type ```slime```.  <br>
3. Open a lisp file.  <br>
4. Press  ```ctrl-c-k``` at the end of the file.
5. See the result.
