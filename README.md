# ExampleAI
Examples and exercises with Lisp and an application to AI.

#Prerequisities
For the project i'm going to work with (SBCL) a high performance Common Lisp compiler and the Emacs editor (you will want a development environment which is more human friendly than the basic SBCL). 

["Install SBCL on Linux/OsX/Windows"](http://www.sbcl.org/platform-table.html) <br />
["Install Emacs on Linux/OsX/Windows"](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) <br />
["Integrate SBCL with Emacs"](https://github.com/slime/slime)

#Run the examples  
If you want to inspect what is doing the examples, you can compile the file or simply copy&paste into the SBCL command line for example:
```
*(list '(Hello World))
```

```
(HELLO WORLD)
```
